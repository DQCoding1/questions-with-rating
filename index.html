      Welcome to your Voice Employee survery. This survery is an opportunity 
      to voice your views about working at Oracle, how the business is operating,
      and how it can be more productive. Your insights are important to the 
      management team, and key finding from the survey will be used to help 
      the organization continue to improve its effectiveness
    </p>
    <p>
      Every item in the survey provides an opportunity for you to add comments. 
      Just hover below your selected rating to show the '+ Comment' button and 
      click it to add a comment. Once finished, please be sure to click 'Save' 
      button, otherwise your response will not be submitted to Glint. Your 
      comments will be reported exactly as you write them if at least 15 people 
      respond to a question. Take care not to identify yourself or others in 
      your comments with the words or language you use.

      Note: If you have witnessed or suspect a violation of Oracle's code of 
      Ethics and Business Conduct, please report it through Oracle's Compliance 
      and Ethics helpline via phone or by using the online website. Your HR 
      representative is another contact point. Due to the confidential nature 
      of the survey, Oracle will not be able to act on such issues in your 
      comments here.
